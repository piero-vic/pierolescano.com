tags: []

- As the name suggest the **core** domain logic of the software should be **functional**. It must rely on immutable
  values and pure functions.
- The **shell** can be programmed in an **imperative** style. It will take care of all the side effects like making and
  responding to network requests.
- The **shell** can call the **core** but not the other way around.
