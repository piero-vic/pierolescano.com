# API Pagination

A list of ways to add pagination to an API.

## Page based pagination

```http
GET http://localhost:3000/items?page=2&size=3
```

- `page` is the number of the page.
- `size` is the number of elements in the page.

## Offset based pagination

Mapping directly to SQL clauses. _OFFSET_ and _LIMIT_.

```http
GET http://localhost:3000/items?offset=20&limit=10
```

The previous request would map to the following SQL query.

```sql
SELECT * from items LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

Offset can cause performance issues when the data grows larger. This is because the database needs to scan all the rows
until the offset value.[^1]

## Cursor based pagination

<!-- TODO: Review -->

- **Better for large and fast-changing datasets.**
- The cursor value can be hashed for security.

### Keyset based pagination

It uses and index key like a primary key.

```sql
SELECT * from items WHERE id <= 1234 LIMIT 20;
```

### Time based pagination

It uses timestamps as cursors.
