The OSI Model is an architectural model that provides a common reference for discussing
[network protocols](network-protocols).

## Layers

The model contains seven layers. Each layer is built on top of the previous. Each layer might have many protocols
suitable to fulfill the functions of the layer.

Protocols on specific layer are only concerned with communicating with its peers, other implementations of the same
protocol. Protocols are not concerned with the layers above or bellow.

1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer
