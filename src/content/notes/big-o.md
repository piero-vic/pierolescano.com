A standardize way to measure how an algorithm's performance changes as the amount of data it receives increases.

1. It measures **growth** with respect to the **input**. If algorithm receives N elements as input, how many steps will
   it take to finish?
2. **Constants are dropped** because they are not concerned with the size of the input.
3. It generally refers to the **worst-case scenario**.

| Notation | Name        | Description                                                      |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| O(1)     | Constant    | Doesn't increase when the amount of data changes                 |
| O(n)     | Linear      | Increases one step each time the data has one additional element |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Increases one step each time the data is doubled                 |
| O(n^2)   | Quadratic   |                                                                  |
