March has been a slow month. I've not being doing much.

## Reading

I'm still waiting for _Wind and Truth_. It was published last December, but I haven't found the Spanish translation in
any of the book stores I frequent. Just to keep the streak going I started reading _The Hobbit_. Maybe I end up
re-reading Lord of the Rings.

## Watching

I went to see [Flow](https://letterboxd.com/film/flow-2024/), an Oscar-winning movie that happens to have been created
with Blender. I'm a huge open source nerd and, to be honest, the fact that the movie was made with Blender was the only
reason I wanted to see it.

## Self-hosting

I don't think much with my self-hosted setup. It works fine without me having to constantly monitor it. However, once a
month or so I check if there are any new applications worth deploying. This month I decide to try to add a single
sign-on service to centralize the authentication for the apps I'm running on my Raspberry Pi.

[Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) seemed to be the easiest to set up. It is also written in Go, which is a plus for
me. At this point almost all the services I run are written in Go.

## Development

I've been exploring how to build Discord bots, practicing data structures and algorithms and also checking out some
stuff with D-Bus. Apart from that not much else. The lifting tracker app has been staled for a while. I need to get back
to it.
